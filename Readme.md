# Aviary
==========
Inspired by the creative capabilities of popular RTS, City Builder and Tycoon games, the vision of Aviary 
(still in early & open development), is to provide an equivalent collection of simple to use editors, that are 
fully cooperative, with zero proprietary lock-in. Users retain usage rights to any of their work 
(subject to attribution).

# Contributions
The project is written in Go + Godot via the graphics.gd project, install the graphics.gd/cmd and use `gd run` 
to build and run it. See the roadmap on the [Aviary](https://the.quetzal.community/aviary) for planned features. 

# Open Software
Aviary is open software available under [The Quetzal Community Trademark License](https://the.quetzal.community/trademark-license) 
which means you can do whatever you like with it as long as you share any modifications you make to the buildable 
source and respect the community trademarks. Please [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/pHevYnFV2t) for support 
or to leave feedback on the project.
