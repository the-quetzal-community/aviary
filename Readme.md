# Aviary
==========
Inspired by the creative capabilities of popular RTS, City Builder and Tycoon games, the vision of Aviary (still early in development), is to provide an equivalent collection of simple to use editors, that are fully cooperative, with zero proprietary lock-in. Users retain usage rights to any of their work (subject to attribution).
